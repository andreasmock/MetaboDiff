# MetaboDiff 

Comparative metabolomics comes of age through commercial vendors offering metabolomics for translational researchers outside the mass spectrometry field. The MetaboDiff packages aims to provide a low-level entry to differential metabolomic analysis with R by starting off with the table of metabolite measurements. As a key functionality, MetaboDiffs offers the exploration of sample traits in a data-derived metabolic correlation network.
